## 2026-08-11

- 13:29 — Project start. Environment: Windows 11, Python 3.12.10, uv 0.11.7, no
  Docker, RTX 4070 SUPER 12 GB (TF CPU-only on native Windows).
- 13:45 — Core scaffold committed: schemas + deterministic claim gate + `sb` CLI;
  12 unit tests green.
- 13:42 — arXiv:2607.05489 verified via API ("Black Hole Black Boxes..."); PDF
  sha256=40b0fb98...; 33 pages.
- 13:51 — Upstream pinned @ 54736e46. License conflict found: LICENSE=GPL-2.0 vs
  pyproject=MIT. TensorFlow/float64 stack. No candidate checkpoints in repo.
- 13:59 — Upstream smoke run (hps_local_lorentzian, 100 epochs, CPU): exit 0, final
  loss 1.57e-10; artifacts hashed.
- 14:05 — Verifier calibration sweep (analytic Schwarzschild, x=(0,8,1.1,0.3)):
  h=3e-3 optimal; max|Ricci| 8.7e-11; Kretschmann rel err 1.1e-9. 16 tests green.
- 14:07 — Export interface end-to-end: 33 stencil points, independent FD Ricci of
  smoke model max|R_ab|=3.3e-6 at (0.1,0.2) vs upstream loss 1.6e-10 — flagged as
  unexplained, no conclusions.
- 14:50 — Discrepancy EXPLAINED (measured): FD sweep stable (ratio 1.0002);
  sqrt(1.57e-10)=1.253e-5 vs our max|Ricci|=1.261e-5 (0.7%); full upstream formula
  replicated with our Ricci: 8.08e-11 vs 1.57e-10 (factor 1.94).
- 14:50 — 4D known-answer pipeline PASS (analytic route): floor 6.7e-9..1.5e-8;
  Kretschmann vs independent Lambert-W r(T,X): 4.4e-9..1.2e-8; Lorentzian signature
  at all probes. NN interim (31/500 epochs, exploratory): Ricci 0.09..0.18,
  Kretschmann 0.4..1.7%.
- 15:00 — float32 test: median residual inflation 203x (float64 median 7.87e-6 vs
  float32 1.60e-3 over 197 grid points). Protocol: float64 mandatory.
- 15:00 — EXP-0001 frozen (config sha 5e39a538..., command, analysis plan);
  H-0001 frozen. Clean 500-epoch baseline run started (CPU, BelowNormal, 6 threads).
- 15:10 — Proof-Gate implemented. Stage-1 ENGINEERING VERIFIED (4/4);
  Stage-2 VERIFIED (8/8). Attestations with SHA-256; integrity check passes.
- 15:07 — WSL2 + Ubuntu installed; Windows reboot pending (founder decision).
- 15:50 — Recon: upstream git history clean; 0 citations of the paper (likely first
  independent audit); seed_models/old has 11 architecture variants.
- 16:00 — AL_embed supervised seed measured: max|Ricci| 0.064-0.149, Kretschmann err
  1.5-8.2% — worse curvature than 6%-trained unsupervised interim. Recorded, no claim.
- 16:05 — Dashboard translated to English; game-style Mission Control (quest map,
  HUD, proof-gate chips). Screenshot: visuals/dashboard-mission-control-2026-08-11.png.
- 16:05 — Article folder created (this file).
- 18:00 — Baseline training milestone: epoch 100/500, loss 1.03e-3 (clean run, CPU BelowNormal).
- 20:45 — Baseline training milestone: epoch 200/500, loss 7.64e-4.
- 22:54 — Reboot for WSL2; CPU run preserved at epoch 275 (loss 7.04e-4, checkpoint sha 550a9463...). GPU env install in progress. Loss-curve visual saved.
- 23:34 — GPU measured: 17 min/epoch (float64 on consumer RTX = 1/64 FP64 rate) vs CPU 1.7 min/epoch — GPU 10x SLOWER; documented, falling back to full-speed CPU for the night. GPU finding itself is article material.
- 23:45 — Full-speed CPU rate measured: 26 s/epoch (3 epochs / 78 s). New ETA: baseline complete ~03:15, thresholds frozen ~04:30, candidate launch ~04:45.
